NAME
    POE::Declare::Log::File - A simple HTTP client based on POE::Declare

SYNOPSIS
        # Create the web server
        my $http = POE::Declare::Log::File->new(
            Filename => '/var/log/my.log',
            Lazy     => 1,
        );
        
    # Control with methods
        $http->start;
        $http->GET('http://google.com');
        $http->stop;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simple logging module which spools output to a
    file, queueing and batching messages in memory if the message rate
    exceeds the responsiveness of the filesystem.

    The implementation is intentionally minimalist and has no dependencies
    beyond those of POE::Declare itself, which makes this module useful for
    simple utility logging or debugging systems.

METHODS
  new
        my $server = POE::Declare::Log::File->new(
            Filename      => 
            ShutdownEvent => \&on_shutdown,
        );

    The "new" constructor sets up a reusable HTTP client that can be enabled
    and disabled repeatedly as needed.

  start
    The "start" method enables the web server. If the server is already
    running, this method will shortcut and do nothing.

    If called before POE has been started, the web server will start
    immediately once POE is running.

  stop
    The "stop" method disables the web server. If the server is not running,
    this method will shortcut and do nothing.

  print
        $log->print("This is a log message");

    Writes one or more messages to the log.

    Returns true if the message will be flushed to the file immediately,
    false if the message will be queued for later dispatch, or "undef" if
    the logger is disabled and the message will be dropped.
